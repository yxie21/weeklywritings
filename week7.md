Licenses are important in open-source codes and could even trigger relevant lawsuits. Similar to writers an photographers who maintain copyright over their works, coders also have copyright over the codes that they arduously developed. 

Most organizations and companies, regardless of their size, make use of a tremendous amount of open source codes of other creators. Most of their components are drawn from the already developed open-source codes in order to shorten the amount of time in their development of software and be able to reach the market at a faster rate. In this process, it is important for the organizations to take notice of the licensing conditions of the original codes. If not, the company might have to disclose to the public the source codes of its commercially developed products or might even have to compensate a large amount of money to the developers of the codes. Surprisingly, applications utilize on average over 200 open-source codes, and thus it could be very easy for companies to make mistakes of breaching the usage conditions of others’ source codes. 

In order to understand and distinguish among the different types of licenses, it is first critical to clarify the meanings of copyleft and copyright. In simple words, copyright restricts user freedom while copyleft does the opposite, granting users freedom despite of the existence of certain limitations. With a copyright license, the creators can specify and enact policies regarding how other users could modify, use, or distribute their codes. Usually, the codes without a specified license is assumed to be copyright, with all rights preserved to the authors of the codes. If you actually want your source codes to be available to others, you have to attach a license to it. On the other hand, copyleft gives users freedom in implementing the codes, but any code that derives from those original source codes need to be open to the public as well, which makes it not a very desirable option for the companies who would prefer to keep their codes confidential to their competitors. 

When deciding which license to choose, it is important to know your intention and motivation for the code. If you want it to be specifically applicable to the community that you are working with, it is preferable to choose a license that the community recommends or the majority of other programmers adopt (ex. GNU recommends GNU GPLv3 for most programs). For most coders, if you simply want you code to be permissive and allow others to freely make changes or distribute for their own purposes, you can use the MIT license, which is commonly used for GitHub libraries. Some other conventions include that if you are extending or making modifications to other people’s libraries, you should use the same license as the author of the code.
