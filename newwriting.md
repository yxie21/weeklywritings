As the open source movement gets increasingly popular, many companies make open source software. It thus becomes a question for many: how do these open source software companies make money?

There are usually two prerequisites for the companies that create open source software. First, these companies have a large community of users. Usually, for these companies, they have a very low return rate. Therefore, they can only ensure their own profits if their products could be utilized by a large amount of consumers. This makes a lot of open source software developers nowadays launch their projects in large and renowned companies, such as Yahoo, so that they could make use of the already well-established customer base. Also, another aspect that these companies share in common is that they have primary credibility within their communities, which means that they can easily become the preferable choice for the majority of the users when competing with other companies in the industry because of their previously established credibility and reputation. 

One way by which many of these companies operate is that while making most of their source codes available to the public, they keep some parts of their software is proprietary, and that proprietary portion of the software generates profits for the developers. Another common approach to make money is to utilize restrictive licensing. In this way, the users of the open source software would bear the legal responsibility to pay for the software. The developers adopt licenses that could easily lead the users to trigger legal issues and thus be obliged to compensate the developers financially. Actually, there are a lot of licenses that serve this purpose, like GPL and AGPL licenses. A third method that has recently gained its popularity is hybrid licensing. By using hybrid licensing, the companiesâ€™ repositories include both open source codes and also proprietary functions under a separate license. When users use the software, they have two options: either use solely the open-source portion or they could pay to use the whole function including the proprietary ones. 

In reality, most of the companies combine the aforementioned approaches to generate venues in order to better fit their own individual business models. While it would be beneficial for some companies to solely adopt one of the previous models, others need to layer the different methods together to create the maximum amount of profit possible.
