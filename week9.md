As programmers eager to take part in the open source movement, it is important to build an inclusive and welcoming community for others. There are some common conventions that open-source repositories should follow in order to be helpful and easy-to-understand for others. 

First, it is important to ensure that the library is very easy to comprehend for other users. One of the techniques to accomplish this is to include a clear readme file. Readme file needs to be written in technical yet conversational tone so that it is accurate but also explanatory. Readme files need to tell the users the functions included in the library and some other basic information, such as the language used and a brief summary of the overall project.

Also, it is critical for the creator of the library to tell other users how they could possibly contribute. Probably, create a contribution file in the library as well, indicating what codes or organization work other users could help with. It is also equally important to keep the contribution document simple and concise so that other users would not lose patience and get confused. 

Additionally, the creators of the libraries need to help others feel included and respected. Creators should always check the pull requests they receive and give feedbacks to the people who offer to help, or else users would no longer feel motivated to contribute to the project if their pull requests are always left unopened. For the pull requests that the users decide to accept, it would be polite to write a short appreciation note to the contributor. Even for pull requests that are not personally useful, it would still be nice for the creators to communicate briefly with the contributors, possibly explaining kindly why he/she does not want to accept the pull request. 

Another tool that creators could consider utilizing is the enacting a code of conduct to avoid negative behavior. When encountering unpleasant interactions, the creators should still be as polite as possible. The code of conduct document can be incorporated into the library as well. Creators should prohibit any kind of harassment or discrimination, regardless of whom it is targeted at. Other users involved in the project should be protected as well. 

In general, similar to maintaining any type of community in real-life settings, the coder community can only be safe and vibrant if everyone invests time and effort to connecting with other coders and respecting each otherâ€™s perspective.
