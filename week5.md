# Changing of Terminology in Coding Communities

In the coding society nowadays, a lot of people have proposed to eliminate certain terminologies that might have racially degrading connotations for some people. 

Many communities are now starting to adopt the idea of changing the default branch name from “master” to “main.” Referring to “master/slave” is problematic as it brings back people’s painful memories of enslavement in the historical context. Similarly, the idea of “blacklist” symbolizing the bad list and the “whitelist” for the good seems to echo with the prejudiced racial perspective that blackness is associated with evilness while whiteness is more sublime. The existence of such psychological hurtful terminologies potentially discourage some users because they do not feel fully embraced and respected and might be very sensitive to the word choice. 

Surely, alternative words could replace the controversial terms, like “main” for “master,” “replica” for “slave,” and “blocklist and allowlist” for “blacklist” and “whitelist.” However, this is technically challenging because the insertion of these more inclusive wordings and the accommodations that should be made to the existing repositories could take a lot of hard work and time from the developers. 

Actually, there are a lot of efforts underway currently. GitHub is now gradually introducing the change from “master” to “main” in naming the default branch. In order to not cause any inconvenience to the users, GitHub is striving to make this transition seamless. While users creating new repositories will be told how and when to use “main” as the default name, users could also make such changes to their existing repositories, in which all of the corresponding changes would be made by GitHub automatically. Similarly, Google’s Android and Chrome teams are also attempting to change the terms in the databases. 

Widespread change to the usage of new terms means that such a transition needs to be fully acknowledged by everyone and that everyone is well-informed of the intentions to do so. Since codes need to be understood not only by the programmers themselves but also by others, it is critical for everyone to be aware of the shift towards the inclusive terminologies and the abandonment of the previous ones. 

Additionally, it is important for the entire software industry to reach consensus on voluntarily changing the problematic terminologies. While the large companies, probably due to public pressure or the larger team of developers, have already dedicated themselves to making such changes immediately, the independent and smaller project developers have not yet voluntarily joined such movement. Some of them morally support this cause, but are still impeded by the technical difficulties as they have to worry about potentially breaking forks or pending pull requests when switching to the new names.
