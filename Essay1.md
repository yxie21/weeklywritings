Hacktoberfest, which is intended to encourage more people to get involved in the open source movement, has become a nuisance to the websites, such as GitHub. Because of the reward of a free T-shirt to anyone submitting a pull request, many participants irresponsibly submit spam pull requests and it becomes painstaking work for the maintainers to get rid of the spams. In response to the spam problem, some people, such as Domenic, have adopted an overtly negative and spiteful view towards Hacktoberfest and even openly accuses the organizer, DigitalOcean. 

While I disagree with Domenic’s standpoint of completely shutting down Hacktoberfest because there could be some very meaningful contributions, I think there are some possible solutions to address this issue. First, it might be helpful to divide the participants up into smaller groups, in which each group incorporates an authorized supervisor that overviews the pull requests before granting them rights for submission. This would not only offer the participants a good opportunity to form close bonds with their peers in the groups, but could also improve the quality of the submitted pull requests. Also, either allowing the spammers to abuse the system waywardly or completely discrediting someone who accidentally puts in one spam request among multiple useful ones would be unreasonable. Therefore, I would suggest that DigitalOcean generates an automatic credit system for the participants. For instance, the participants could be rewarded one point for the pull requests not considered spams and five points for accepted ones. Meanwhile, three points would be deducted for each spam request as a penalty. Only those participants that end up with a relatively good overall credit could earn the prize. By doing so, those who have malicious intention and solely want to gain the prize through spamming would be eliminated out of the game, and others who have made helpful contributions yet committed some sort of spam behavior would still have their good work acknowledged. If financially possible, the organization could even give out monetary rewards to the top contributors so that the coders would be motivated to make changes of actual usage and value. 

Another alternative approach would be to give T-shirts only to those whose codes are successfully merged, while the timespan taken for the merge to take place does not have to be within the time interval of Hacktoberfest. Thus, even those whose codes get merged later on would be rewarded righteously. 

Furthermore, probably GitHub could simplify the process to close an invalid pull request. Currently, the whole process of “closing it, tagging it as spam, locking the thread to prevent further spam comments, and then reporting the spammer to GitHub” is too time-consuming, and there are even owners of repositories who do not know how to deal with such circumstance. GitHub could change the process of deleting spams and providing the users with a garbage can so that they could retreat the good ones they deleted by accident. It could also save the maintainers’ vast amount of time if GitHub could develop an automatic spam detection system so that the apparently useless ones would not need to be manually addressed upon by the maintainers.
